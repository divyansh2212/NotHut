# NotHut

1. Hello everyone! I created a notHut app which can be used to add the notes with title and its description. In this, React useState is used to keep track of the current data which is written by the user.

2. Also, we can delete the existing notes and create the new ones!

3. Tech stack used : React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
